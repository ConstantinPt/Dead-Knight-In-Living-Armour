The locomotive stopped with a squeaking sound scattering sparks all over the rails.It was raining once in a while lightnings would hit high points, one of them hit a nearby tree and 
left a burning mark on the old bark.Lazy  wagons were following the locomotive as it stopped in the train station.Inside a choking hotness and the combining smell of cheap food and dirty clothes.Today was a lighter day not too much passengers thats why Victor had only one roommate in the cabin.An old man over fifty with a thick black beard and calm hazel eyes, a silent man not  the talkie-wookie type. This was the best thing Victor could hope for, he himself was a silent guy and didn't like to talk much so it had to be perfect for him.
Too hot inside the cabin's window was covered in steam, Victor took a moment to wipe it clean with the sleeve of his shirt.
Pas the window a beautiful forest in autumn colors and the calming sound of rain falling.A beautiful symphony of nature.
When he got bored looking through the window  he took out a book out of his bag and started reading sinking deep in between the lines becoming one with the yellow pages and dry ink.Time flies when one reads something good so it did for Victor. Soon the sun faded leaving a golden trace in the skies.
He dropped the book back in the bag and got in the hard wood bed 
eyes fixed to ceiling empty of thoughts he felt free and empty at the same time.
