"When did he left? Athena asked the woman"
"Im not too sure,maybe a few days ago, he didnt talk too much, just paid me in advance for the flat and told me to buy some sweets for my grandchildren"
"But he knew well I dont have any, I think he wasnt alright,maybe something was bothering him,he was stranger in the last period of time"
The old woman left for a minute and came back with a small box warped in a rough sand paper like texture. 
"He left me this box and told me handdle it to you miss,he said(I know she will come)"
The redhead took the pack, bowed her head a bit as a sign of gratitude and left wishing a good day to the lady.
Grandchild-less Grandma stood stoned for a while watching Athena walk away graceful until she left rotten building.
Usually autumns are light and warm but when octomber hits something shifts.
Athena steped into the street.The rain wont stop for a few days now.A noisy neighborhood never felt so desolated.Everyone was hiding under the rooftops next to their 
fireplaces.Night falling down like a veil.Every lantern on the street was broken exepting the one in the far left corner where under the pale light in ghotic letters under peeling layers of cheap paint one could read "The House of Flowers".
The only flower shop in the neighborhood an old room with a big pannel of glass,insde hundreds of flowers, even the poor buy flowers sometimes.
The redhead stoped gazing into the glass, two green eyes under the black lace.
Inside a women helped by her son  was cutting of stems of the older roses and the boy had to change the water in every vase.
The kid saw the lady in black and rushed to ask if she needs any help.When he reached the street Athena vanished.He shruged and went back in.
After an half of hour the carriage stoped,she left.
She rushed in her room and tore apart the paper and found a small letter on a imaculate white piece of paper near to a darkbrown notebook.
It came naturally.The where flowing inside her.But she did not cry.Big girls dont cry.
