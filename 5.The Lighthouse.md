Salty and wet the sea breaks through my nose.Pitch darkness,somewhere close i can hear the waves clash into the beach.Look up.The first stars draw mystical patterns on the black sky.Far away a lighthouse stands whose light runs like a mad eye in search of something.The ships that never returned form sails.I get up and move towards the lighthouse each step brings me close to the tower but when I try the door its locked. A deep fog engulfs me  the skies blacken. I look back towards the beach and where lay the sea now thousands of towers rise each with his own light searching. And suddenly the skies blow in light the stars shine bright for a second then dim back like broken light bulbs. I hear a voice somewhere near. A soft voice thats flows within me.
"Hundreds and thousands of stars,so many worlds,so many variants,possibilities,yet you chose this one"
I couldnt understand where the voice was coming from.Im turning round seeking for her.Finally I see a shadow next to the lighthouse the one I was closer to.
Whats happening ? Where I am ? On auto my legs start moving towards the shadow when the voice strikes again.
"Unlimited possibilities,somewhere you are not born yet in some you are good and in some bad, some worlds you've burned some saved,in some you are dead and  some moan your loss,a hero a prophet yet you chose this world"
I know she's at my back and when I turn the lighthouse's  ray hits my eyes and through i can see only a pair of blue sapphire eyes.
"Run dont let the tower see you" "Into the shades",my heart pounds heavy,the eye burns my back "RUN" the voice screams inside my head, I hide in between some rocks and the EYE looses me and starts running around like a mad animal who lost the scent of his prey.
Then she vanishes and reappears next to a far end tower.
"Constants and Variables" her last words 
Then she opens the door and disappears. And the world disintegrates the towers crash and the sea is washed away , I feel a free fall and wake up staring at the ceiling.
