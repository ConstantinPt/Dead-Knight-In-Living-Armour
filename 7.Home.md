Both looked at each other, strangers but still, something familiar where waving around them. Moments later it hit them both.

"Eve?"

"Vic?" 

This is how they used to name themselves as children.
Both changed. Tike took its tol on since the last time. 
"Home at last?"
"For now, as you can see"
"My, you've grown into a beautiful woman Eve, a walking Angel"
Eve blushed.
"Stop it you, instead let me walk you home, its been a while"
She took his hand and dragged him down the alley towards home.


Walking slow while Evelyn was talking about the changes, some streets renamed, some buildings demolished, some people departed and some new came to the city
but all of this made no sense for Victor, he had her even for a while and the world stopped breathing. This frail creature he was following like Theseus following 
the golden thread of Ariadne.

Soon they've reached Eve's house.
Near a group of people led by Eve's father were debating some regional political issues.
The debates reached a boiling point when she showed up with Victor holding his hand.
He recognized Evelyn's father, grizzled but still standing tall and full of life.
When he saw her holding hands with a stranger he frowned but as they came in closer everything cleared out.

"Dam me if I'm wrong, it's you Victor, boy ?"

"No doubt it cant be another, you look exactly like your father at this age"

He hugged Victor and smiled like a child
"Mother's gonna be happy to see her boy became man" 

It didn't took them  too much time until they reached for Victor's house.
Eve kissed him lightly on the forehead, and went back singing.

Victor knocked in the door and soon heard the key turn in the lock and the door opened.
She dropped the key and Victor hasted to pick it up and hugged his mother.

"Dont cry, I'm here now"

"Forgive me I've been missing"
