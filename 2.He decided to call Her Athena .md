Dear Athena

Life.There is something strange about It.At this point I feel like Im stuck, cant go back cant go further.How are you Athena? I havent heard of you in a while.
If you knew how much I miss you but I chose to go away.In time I have learned a lot of things about me.I am prideful, so prideful its rooting me from inside.
You will always remain a part of me. 
Id like to see you one day talk about small things like we did in the old days.I never got bored of you but i guess it will have to wait.
We will meet in future, by then you will be maried probably and me I'll have my imaginary dragons.
For now I must bear this mask for this is my way and once I steped on it I have to go till the end.I know it lies in North,the story you never belived in,you always laughed about 
the story, but I know, I wont backdown even if it costs my life, the reaserch of my punny life may end in something greater than everyone expects,I know everyone laughs and you feel ashamed of me ashamed beeing mine.But know Athena one day I'll change the world and you will rember my name.
You always had somethig about your eyes, I remeber the night I meet you, that green still shines in my heart and it will always be.
I still go the the same place by the night It sill has your smell after all these years.
I see how you look at them, they sell lies but for this live in luxorious flats and wear fine silk. But me, I have to find my own way.
Im stuck in this flat living with my friends mice and cocroaches, eat once a day but I dont mind,you know why? Because I know deep inside I know that the truth lies somwhere there awayting for me thats why i decided to go away and if I'll not find my dead maybe I'll find the truth.
I know there is no one like you and I'll never search for someone like you,you'll always ache in my heart.
You are the queen of flowers who blooms only in the dark light of the moon.
I feel alone sometimes, missunderstood but I dont mind it one day it will end anyway.I just wonder why I cant forget you and moove on. Blind I dont see others around me, its only you now.
You know what is wrong with humans today? they dont understand the meaning of love, feelings are mistaken with bodyly pleasure and temporary lust.
I see the time pases fast,now a part of me has to remain in this notebook, a part of my soul in locked in here, this was needed so i could step into the future,keep it safe for me.
Forgive me Athena.
