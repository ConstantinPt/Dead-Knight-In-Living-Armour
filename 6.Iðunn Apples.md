He woke up staring at the ceiling. For a moment closing and reopening the eyes to reassure that he woke up. Fresh ray of autumn sun were falling on the table in the middle of the wagon. The old man was already awake, the day before he didn't notice that the man was wearing an eye patch over his right eye. As soon as he saw Victor the old man saluted him, he was eating an apple. Victor saluted him too. On the table bathing in the rays of morning light lay three golden apples. He looked at them and his stomach roared in hunger. The old man handed him one apple.

"I take no refuses" he smiled 
Victor accepted the apple and bite into it like a hungry wolfs bites into a dead deer. Sweet, so sweet, Victor never had before an apple to taste so sweet.
He expected the apple to be a bit sour instead he got a honey taste.
"This apple, its something like I've never tasted before"
"Yes they are quite uncommon, a rare species and I gotta say they are also dam pretentious to conditions"
"But, I guess the work is worth it?"
The old man chuckled.
"Well it would be if the tree would give more than a few apples once in a decade" 
"A decade?" 
"Some things take patience son"
"It cant be, or at least I've never heard of something like this in my entire life"
"Life is mysterious and some things can barely be counted as real but sometimes they are"

Victor took some time to think. 
"Am I really awake ?" he thought to himself. 
"This cant be. This cant possible be." "Im overthinking too much"

His silence was broken by the old man.
"Take the remaining apples son, and have a nice day, my station is up ahead"
The old man took his luggage and steeped outside the room.
"Thank you mister"
"Don't son its my pleasure"
"Mister?"
"Yes kid?"
"Your name?"
"Din"
"I'm Vic..."
"Victor" I know
"Good luck kid"

The train stopped. The old man got out and suddenly it started to rain.  
Somewhere distant Victor heard a group of crows.
Such a strange encounter. 
For a moment the flashbacks of the las night's dream hit him. So many questions.
The memories unclear.

"I remember when I was a child I had a dream that would repeat over and over and I would know it so well but now the details are fading just like in the last night's dream."
"I'll probably forget about it soon enough"  

The rain kept pouring.
